  <title>Shred the files</title>

  <p>When you have loaded all the files that you wish to shred, press the red
  <gui>Shred</gui> button at the upper left of the window, next to the add file
  button. Then each file loaded will acquire a progress bar that will show how
  much of the shredding has been finished.</p>


  <p>When each file finishes shredding, it will disappear from the list, and
  a desktop notification will say that the shredding has been finished.</p>

  <note style="warning">
    <p>Do NOT close the window until all files have finished shredding. When
    the window goes back to its empty state, then all shredding is finished,
    and you can close the window safely.</p>
