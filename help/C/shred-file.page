  <title>Shred the files</title>

  <p>When you have loaded all the files that you wish to shred, press the red
  <gui>Shred</gui> button at the bottom of the window. Each file loaded
  will acquire a progress indicator that will show how much of the shredding
  has been finished. You can click on the progress indicator to view more
  information regarding the shredding progress of that file.</p>

  <p>When shredding starts, the <gui>Shred</gui> is replaced with a
  <gui>Abort</gui> button. Press this if you started shredding on a file that
  you do not want to be shredded. The files opened will still be loaded after
  <gui>Abort</gui> is pressed, but they will no longer be in shredding.</p>

  <p>When all shredding finishes, a notification will say that the shredding has
  been finished. It will be an in-app notification if the window is focused
  but be a desktop notification otherwise.</p>

  <note style="warning">
    <p>Do NOT close the window until all files have finished shredding. When
    the window goes back to its empty state, then all shredding is finished,
    and you can close the window safely.</p>
