## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/adbeveridge/raider/issues/new/).
Just describe the problem clearly, and expect a revision from between a week
or several months, depending on wether it is a bug in the interface, or if it
is a bug in the actual shredding program.
