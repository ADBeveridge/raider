File Shredder is a file deletion program designed to permanently remove sensitive files from your computer, enhancing data privacy

Within a certain limit, it is effective. However, modern SSDs use certain technologies to extend its lifetime, which has the side effect of ensuring that shredding is never perfect, and no software can fix that. But shredding significantly increases the difficulty of data recovery since it requires specialized software and hardware.
